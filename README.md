<b>● How it's working</b> 

<br>
<br> 

This is a script made in python, that uses web servers [response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status), to check whether on a particular sites url when given a parameter with a value, if it gives 404 or 200 response . If it gives 200 then it means the site has the particular user . And if 404 or any bad response then it means the username doesn’t exist on that particular site.
