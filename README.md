# Use python search4.py to run the script .
# Enter users username without '@' symbol 


# Short and Sweet Explanation 


A script that uses web servers response to check whether on a particular sites link it shows 404 or 200 response

If it’s 200 then it means the site gave some information, it’s OK. That means the username om the site exits.

And if 404, then the username doesn’t exist on that particular site
